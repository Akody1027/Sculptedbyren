        <h4>
        Dihydroxyacetone (DHA for short) is the active ingredient in all sunless 
        tanners. It’s a colorless, natural, plant-derived compound that has been
         approved by the FDA for external application for over 50 years. Sculpted By Ren
          uses only eco-certified DHA solutions, and we provide protective eyewear,
        nose filters and lip balm. Additionally, all of our spray tan systems are cleaned
         and sanitized immediately after each session.

    <div id="info3">
        Wearing dark, loose-fitting clothes to your spray tan is best. If possible, wear 
        nail polish—even if your nail polish is a clear coat, it’ll help protect your nails 
        from discoloration.

        Avoid wearing perfumes, deodorant or makeup that can create a barrier for absorption.
         Tight-fitting clothing and shoes such as boots, socks or tights might rub off some
          of the spray tan and cause uneven results—it’s best to be safe and avoid these!

    <div id="after">
        Avoid bathing, swimming or engaging in activities that work up a sweat for at least
         4 hours. Because chlorine can quickly break down a spray tan, we recommend avoiding
          it entirely if possible.
